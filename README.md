# Text-Summarization
This project tackles the challenge of processing large text data by using automated extractive and abstractive summarization. Leveraging the CNN/DailyMail dataset, models like GPT-2, BART, PEGASUS, and T5 generate concise summaries, aiding quick analysis in fields like news, research, and legal review.
